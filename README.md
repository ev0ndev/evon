## Tips for Safer Use 🛡️

Using any executor comes with inherent risks, but following these guidelines significantly reduces potential issues:

- **Use Alt Accounts** - Never use your main Roblox account when testing new scripts or executors
- **Start Small** - Test executor functionality on smaller, less popular games before using on main games
- **Avoid Obvious Exploits** - Scripts that give unrealistic advantages (infinite health, teleportation) trigger automatic detection
- **Update Regularly** - Always use the latest version to benefit from security patches and anti-detection improvements
- **Read Script Reviews** - Community feedback helps identify potentially malicious or detection-prone scripts
- **Limit Session Duration** - Take breaks between script usage to maintain natural activity patterns
- **Disable When Not Needed** - Close the executor completely when playing normally to minimize detection risk
- **Use VPN (Optional)** - Additional privacy layer for users in regions with strict gaming regulations

Remember that while **evon executor safe** protocols are implemented, no executor can guarantee 100% protection from account actions. Exercise caution and common sense when using any third-party tools.
